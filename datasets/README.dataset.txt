**Mangrove Species Image Dataset from Dompak Island by UMRAH Students**

This dataset consists of high-resolution images of mangrove species collected by students from Universitas Maritim Raja Ali Haji (UMRAH), a maritime-focused public university located in Tanjungpinang, Riau Archipelago, Indonesia. The images were taken from various locations across Dompak Island, a coastal area known for its diverse mangrove ecosystems.

The dataset contains labeled images from five mangrove species:
1. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza
2. Lumnitzera littorea
3. Rhizophora apiculata
4. Sonneratia alba
5. Xylocarpus granatum

The purpose of this dataset is to aid in the development of ecological research, biodiversity studies, and machine learning applications such as automated species identification and environmental monitoring.

All photos were taken in natural conditions, capturing the plants in various lighting and environmental situations to ensure diversity and robustness for computer vision tasks.

We express our deepest appreciation to the dedicated contributors who carried out the data collection in the field:
1. Dimas Adrian Arifin
2. Irfan Ibrahim
3. Syawal Nopyandi
4. M. Wisnu Adjie Pramudya
5. Muhammad Ridho
6. Maulana Fitra Ramadhani
7. Rizsky Parsadanta Rajagukguk
8. Zeldiyan Arafat
9. Muhammad Chandra Ramadhan

**Note:**
This dataset does not yet include the full range of mangrove species present on Dompak Island. It serves as an initial contribution and can be expanded in future studies to provide a more comprehensive representation of the islandâ€™s mangrove biodiversity.

This work stands as a small but meaningful effort by UMRAH students to support environmental conservation, promote local ecosystem research, and contribute to the growing field of data-driven ecological science.
